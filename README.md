## Todo App

The Todo App is a cross-platform mobile application built using Flutter and Dart, demonstrating a solid understanding of modern mobile app development principles. This project showcases proficiency in creating applications with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, making use of local storage with sqflite and state management using Bloc/Cubit. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with a simple and intuitive user interface.

## Features
